## Setup

- run `nvm install` to get the npm version defined by `.nvmrc`
- run `nvm alias default lts/{version_name}` if you want to set that npm version as default

### Code Formatting

- There is an `.editorconfig` file to set what is expected as code formatting standards
- Prettier was installed here so you can use the scripts `npm run lint:check` and `npm run lint:fix` to solve formatting issues

### Working with issues + branchs

1. First create a issue
2. Set the issue title rightly, use the pattern `[TMPLT-XXXXX] + issue_title`
3. Use the generated issue number (#X...) to fill the `XXXXX` part

   3.1 As example: if the issue is `#86` the code will be `TMPLT-00086`

   3.2 As another: if is `#3` will be `TMPLT-00003`

4. Follow the pattern `feat/TMPLT-XXXXX` to create branchs based on the issue that was opened
