# Future Considerations

## Purpose

This document captures **possibilities**, not commitments.

It exists to:

- Record ideas without acting on them prematurely
- Acknowledge potential directions
- Avoid losing context over time

---

## Guiding Rule

Future ideas should:

- Respect the original vision
- Not force early technical decisions
- Remain reversible

---

## Possible Evolutions

Examples (non-exhaustive):

- Implementation using a chosen stack
- Interactive elements or user input
- Collaboration or contribution workflows
- Tooling to support the defined concepts

None of these are required.

---

## What This Is Not

- A roadmap
- A promise
- A backlog

It is a **thinking space**, not a delivery plan.

---

## Decision Gate

Before moving anything from this document into execution, ask:

- Is the problem clearly understood?
- Is this aligned with the vision?
- Are we choosing tools for the right reasons?
