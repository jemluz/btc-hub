# Vision

## Purpose

This project exists to define **meaning before implementation**.

Its primary goal is to clarify:

- Why this project should exist
- What problem space it belongs to
- What values guide decisions
- What should remain invariant, even as tools change

Technology choices are considered secondary and provisional.

## Core Principles

- **Clarity over speed**  
  Understanding the problem is more valuable than implementing a solution quickly.

- **Intentionality over convenience**  
  Every decision should be explainable in terms of purpose, not habit.

- **Simplicity over accumulation**  
  What is left out is as important as what is included.

- **Thinking before building**  
  This project prioritizes reasoning, structure, and coherence.

## What This Project Is

- A space to define ideas
- A shared reference for collaborators
- A foundation for future implementations
- A living explanation of intent

---

## What This Project Is Not

- A finished product
- A technology showcase
- A framework-dependent solution
- A collection of premature answers

---

## Success Criteria

This project is successful if:

- New contributors understand the intent without verbal explanation
- Decisions feel consistent over time
- Implementation choices feel obvious when the time comes
