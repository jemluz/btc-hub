# UI Guidelines

## Purpose

These guidelines describe **experience principles**, not visual assets or libraries.

They define _how things should feel and behave_, independent of implementation.

---

## Core Principles

- **Clarity first**  
  The interface should never compete with the content or purpose.

- **Simplicity by design**  
  Fewer elements, fewer choices, fewer distractions.

- **Hierarchy over decoration**  
  Structure and spacing communicate more than visual effects.

- **Consistency over novelty**  
  Predictability builds trust and understanding.

---

## Content-Centered Design

- Interfaces should support reading, thinking, and understanding
- Avoid visual noise
- Avoid unnecessary animations or effects
- Every element should justify its presence

---

## Language & Tone

- Clear and direct
- Human, not institutional
- Accessible without being simplistic
- Avoid intimidation or excessive formalism

---

## Deferred Decisions

The following are intentionally undefined:

- Colors
- Fonts
- Components
- Frameworks

They should be chosen later, in service of these principles.
